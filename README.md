# LELU: Law Enforcement Lookup

Welcome to the **Law Enforcement Lookup (LELU)** repository. This project is designed to provide access to law enforcement data curated by the **Legal Aid Society**. It offers an easy-to-use interface for looking up detailed information about law enforcement officers and agencies.

## What is LELU?

The **Law Enforcement Lookup (LELU)** tool aggregates and organizes law enforcement data to provide transparency and accountability in policing. The data contained in this repository is sourced from the **Legal Aid Society** and is regularly updated to reflect the latest available information.

The repository includes various data files in the form of **TSV** and **YAML** formats, corresponding to each tab in the LELU tool. These files contain valuable information on officers and agencies, such as disciplinary records, complaint histories, and more.

Each dataset is updated with every LELU tool update, ensuring users have access to the most current and accurate law enforcement data.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains folders that hold raw **TSV** and **YAML** files. Each folder corresponds to a specific tab within the LELU tool.

- **TSV Files:** These contain tab-separated values with structured data, typically representing detailed records of law enforcement officers and agencies.
- **YAML Files:** These provide metadata and structured details that support the raw data in the TSV files, making it easier to understand and use.

The files are organized by LELU's sections (such as officer details, agency records, etc.), and each contains its own set of data.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Data**: Navigate to the appropriate folder to access the TSV and YAML files.
2. **Open the Files**: Use a text editor or a data processing tool (such as Python or R) to analyze the data.
3. **Refer to the 'About' Section**: Each LELU tab has an "About" section detailing the origins of the data, helping you better understand the context and sources of information.
4. **Stay Updated**: This repository is updated each time the LELU tool is refreshed, ensuring that the data is always current.

## Data Sources

The information in the LELU tool comes directly from the **Legal Aid Society**. The data is collected and curated from various public records, including police department databases, government reports, and other public-facing law enforcement data.

For more detailed information on how the data is gathered, visit the **About** section within each LELU tab for insights into the specific origins and methodology.
